This is the arduino part of the project [Satellight: Putting lights on satellite](https://satellight.netlify.app/)

### Android

Here a arduino bluetooth connection is used to transfer data from android to arduino. The android takes the user location information and the expected 3D location then after calculating the angle and alevation will send those information to the arduino.

### Arduino
 
 In hardware I have used two stepper motors and bluetooth module and arduino uno.
